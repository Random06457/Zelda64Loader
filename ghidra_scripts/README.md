# F3DZEX Analyzer

This script will try to find F3DZEX microcode.
You can see a demo [here](https://youtu.be/5pj3cz1MITU)</br>
Note: The script is not perfect and might break in some cases

## Usage

In Ghidra's script manager (`Window->Script Manager`), you can find the script in the `Zelda64` category.</br>
Optionally, you can check the `In Tool` to be able to run the script directly from the toolbar.

Place your cursor inside a function and run the script. A window will pop up. Select an option and click OK.
The F3DZEX output will then appear in EOL comments.
